10	! L from Muinonen & Saarinen - needs to be large compared to correlation length(s)
5	! hexagon radius hr
4 	! number of subfacets along each hexagon edge - should be large enough to correctly plot the correlation length     nfhr
10	! length of prism surfaces   pfl
8	! number of subfacets along prism facet length - should be even and large enough to correctly plot the correlation length nfpl
1	! number of rotations to perform at prism facet-basal facet edges (10% of #subfacets along prism edge) pher
2	! number of rotations to perform at prism facet-prism facet edges (10% of #subfacets along hexagon edge) pper
1	! number of roughness scales sc required - supply correlation length and standard deviation for each below in pairs
2	! correlation length 1 CL1
0	! standard deviation 1 SD1
